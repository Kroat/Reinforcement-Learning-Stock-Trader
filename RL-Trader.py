# Reinforcement Learning Equity Trader
# By Matija Krolo || github.com/Kroat
# To use:
# 1.) Ensure all necessary libraries are installed on your machine (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas)
# 2.) Place RL-Trader.py in a project directory
# 3.) cd into the project directory
# 4.) Pass the command:
#       RL-Trader.py [EQUITY] [START DATE - DAY/MONTH/YEAR] [STARTING PORTFOLIO VALUE] [HOW MANY TRADES TO RUN BEFORE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING BEGINS]
#
# ex: RL-Trader.py F 1/1/2000 1000 200
# ^ This runs RL-Trader against Ford's historical data and analyzes 200 trades before the Reinforcement Learning begins with a beginning portfolio of $1,000
# ** Please note that this RL script only trades one equity at a time!

# Edit these values to change how the RL brain learns
